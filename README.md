# Hello! I'm Nora.

I'm a student working on engineering projects. Through various academic and personal interests, I
have gained quite a lot of experience with low-level systems programming (Linux kernel, CAN, GPIO,
etc.), 3D hardware-accelerated graphics (Vulkan, OpenGL), and robotics-adjacent design.

## Projects

- [Pancake bot](https://github.com/heyallnorahere/pancake):
FRC-adjacent robot centered around moving linearly and rotating concurrently. Stated goal to obtain
more experience with the robotics development process while making a sick robot at the same time.
Uses FRC electrical components and motors while driven from a Raspberry Pi, controlling motors using
a custom motor driver library interacting with the low-level Linux socket CAN protocol. Chassis
designed completely from the ground up, and built with 3D printed parts.

- [Custom leverless controller](https://github.com/heyallnorahere/custom-leverless):
Custom leverless controller for playing arcade-style fighting games. Uses GP2040-CE firmware running
on a Raspberry Pi Pico. Built overwhelmingly out of DIY materials, such as laser-cut acrylic and 3D
printer filament. Connects to a computer or video game console as a PlayStation 4 controller, and
works very well for playing fighting games.
