# Hello! I'm Nora.

I'm an student working on engineering projects. Through various academic and personal interests, I
have gained quite a lot of experience with low-level systems programming (Linux kernel, CAN, GPIO,
etc.), 3D hardware-accelerated graphics (Vulkan, OpenGL), and robotics-adjacent design.
